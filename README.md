# 👋 Hi, I'm Gabe Corsini

I'm a Security Engineer and U.S. Navy veteran with 10+ years of experience building and defending mission-critical systems. I specialize in **cloud security**, **threat detection**, and **Microsoft security tooling**—especially Microsoft Sentinel, Defender XDR, Entra ID, and PowerShell automation.

I’m passionate about making security **simpler, more scalable, and more human-friendly**. Whether I’m writing a PowerShell module to automate tenant onboarding or crafting a KQL query to catch a subtle phishing attack, I believe in solving real problems and sharing what I learn along the way.

## 🔧 What I Work On

- 🛡 **Detection Engineering** – Building rules and queries in Sentinel and Defender to surface meaningful alerts without the noise.
- 🧠 **Security Automation** – Automating cloud operations using PowerShell, Logic Apps, and Azure-native tools.
- ⚙️ **Compliance Tooling** – Supporting internal product development focused on CMMC and M365/Azure security posture.
- 🎯 **Threat Hunting** – Investigating anomalies, crafting proactive detections, and supporting incident response.
- 📚 **Knowledge Sharing** – Writing clear documentation, building internal wikis, and helping customers understand the “why” behind the tech.
