- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabe Corsini 
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Software Development, Automation, Cybersecurity, the cloud, and really good books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in order to evolve my current skillset beyond Cloud administration and into Software Development, with the goal of working as a Software Engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects in the Java programming languages that could use a beginners touch. 
- 📫 I can be reached at gabe@corsini.tech
